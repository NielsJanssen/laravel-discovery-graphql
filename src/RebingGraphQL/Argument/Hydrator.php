 * ComposedFromArgsHydrator, backed by the ComposedFromArgs interface; a spatie/laravel-data adapter
 * would be `hydrates()` → `is_a($class, Data::class, true)` and `hydrate()` → `$class::from($args)`.
 * Register one by tagging it:
 *
 *     $this->app->tag([MyHydrator::class], Hydrator::TAG);
 *
 * Parameters whose type a hydrator claims are excluded from the generated GraphQL args — the args
 * they are built from come from an ActionArgProvider instead.
