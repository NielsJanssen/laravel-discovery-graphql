 * Contributes validation rules for a discovered action's arguments.

 * This is the hook for wiring in whichever validation library you prefer: ours ships as
 * LaravelValidationRules, but a spatie/laravel-data adapter — or anything else — plugs in on equal
 * footing. Register an implementation by tagging it:
 *
 *     $this->app->tag([MyRules::class], RuleProvider::TAG);
 *
 * Every tagged provider is asked, and their rules merge, so several can coexist. Rules contributed
 * here are merged *on top of* Rebing's own arg-level rules (including #[Arg(rules:)] and the
 * model-binding `exists` rule) rather than replacing them.
